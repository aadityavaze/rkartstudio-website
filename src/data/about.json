      "info":"I have been passionate about painting for as long as I remember and started RK Artworks as a part of RK Art studio in 2018. I work with various mediums such as oil paints, charcoal, colored pencils, watercolours, coffee etc. and have worked on more than 100 portraits in a year. I believe use of various mediums on different papers allows to challenge the boundaries for realistic portraits- capturing minute details to tell stories that explore the depth of the expression. I genuinely feel, paintings are not just about shades, colours and mediums, they are all about stories, expressions and feelings.",
